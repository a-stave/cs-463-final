# CS 463 Final Project  

This project creates a personal portfolio website using the tools we learned in our Intro Web Development course. The finished site is hosted on GitHub Pages ([Link](https://a-stave.github.io/cs-463-final)) and consists of a single webpage. The `About` section contains a short personal introduction, while `Previous Work` summarizes my professional and academic experience and `Projects` presents various public GitHub projects I wish to show off and a GitHub icon that links to the relevant repository. Finally, the `Contact` form may allow visitors to reach out to me, although presently it does not send messages anywhere. The site was built off a foundation of Bootstrap components, notably the nav bar, the resume modal, and the Projects carousel. It includes both a light- and dark-theme to match visitors' preferences, and uses media queries to adjust content for smaller or larger screens using Bootstrap's own breakpoints. (`<768px`, `<1200px`, and `≥1200px`)  

The Projects carousel begins as an empty container; Ajax is used to fetch a list of projects using the GitHub REST API, and the responses are used to create cards that are then added to the DOM. Because my implementation relies on unauthenticated requests the API is limited to 60 requests per hour, after which each project's "Last updated" text should fall back to an error message without interfering with the rest of the card's rendering. In the future, new projects can be easily added to the carousel: Simply specify the project owner and name in the `repos` list and provide a suitable description to appear on the card. While this theoretically allows me to show off contributions to other owners' projects, the "Last updated" text is implemented to fetch the latest commit date, since I assumed I would always be the latest (and only) contributor. In the future, I hope to rework this so it reflects the latest commit made by the user matching `owner`.  

The contact form simply logs input to the console. Eventually I may finish this feature so that messages are forwarded to a mailbox, but for this project it didn't seem necessary. On submitting a message, a response briefly overlays the form to assure users that their message was processed, and the overlay fades so that users can enter additional messages if they wish.

The code should run without any input on the user's end. A working version is published via GitHub Pages, and users can fork their own copies to modify however they'd like. Note that the HTML contains links to Bootstrap styles (v5.0.2), scripts (v5.2.0), and jQuery (v3.5.1).
